Scripts related to human adaptation analsyses from PadrÃ³, De Panis, Luisi, et al. 2022: Ortholog genes from cactophilic Drosophila provide insight into human adaptation to hallucinogenic cacti.

The data used for the analyses can not be distributed and should be request to external researchers as stated in the paper and/or downloading from the 1000 genomes project.

WARNING: Scripts are provided as generated to be run locally without adatping the paths to reach the data.
The arbolescence of the scripts is not warranted as I reordered them for clarity in the github repository

### DataCuration folder: 
scripts related to the steps for filtering individuals to be include for target and reference populations

### PositiveSelection folder:
scripts related to iHS, TreeSelect estimations, and their combinination into Fisher's combination test score, for each dataset separately
scripts to generate summary table and figure
script for enrichement analysis (fig4b).
