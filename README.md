Scripts related to human adaptation analsyses from PadrÃ³, De Panis, Luisi, et al. 2022: Ortholog genes from cactophilic Drosophila provide insight into human adaptation to hallucinogenic cacti.

The data used for the analyses can not be distributed and should be request to external researchers as stated in the paper and/or downloading from the 1000 genomes project.

WARNING: Scripts are provided as generated to be run locally without adapting the paths to reach the data.
Since I reordered the scripts for clarity in the github repository.
The arbolescence of the scripts is not warranted as I reordered them for clarity in the github repository.
If you encounter issues to adapt the script for your needs, just reach me!
